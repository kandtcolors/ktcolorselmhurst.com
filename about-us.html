        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <article>
          <p>K&amp;T Colors has a long Elmhurst history. It came to Elmhurst as &#8220;Art&#8217;s Colors&#8221;, a second location of a paint and wallpaper store. When Kay and Ted took over the ownership, K&amp;T Colors was born and custom picture framing and art supplies were added. That store was located at York St. and Butterfield for 25 years.</p>
          <p>Maryann Gorski and her parents Ed and Loretta Kalina bought K&amp;T Colors in 1986 and relocated it to 568 S. York St. in a 16 foot store front. As picture framing and selection of art materials increased, they dropped wall paint and then wallpaper.</p>
          <p>The BIG change occurred in 2010 when they doubled the size of the store and acquired a totally updated new look. They are now able to offer even more selections of framing and can handle larger art work. </p>
          <p>The art material selection is constantly growing to include many instructional books and art directed gift offerings.</p>
          <p>The newest addition is an answer to many long-standing requests. Art lessons for children and young adults are now offered. </p>
          <p>At the core of their creativity, Maryann and Loretta desire to reinvent themselves everyday to inspire their customers as well as themselves.<br />
