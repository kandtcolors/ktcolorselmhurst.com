											<p>K&amp;T Colors has a long Elmhurst history. It came to Elmhurst as "Art's Colors", a second location of a paint and wallpaper store. When Kay and Ted took over the ownership, K&amp;T Colors was born and custom picture framing and art supplies were added. That store was located at York St. and Butterfield for 25 years.</p>
											<p>Maryann Gorski and her parents Ed and Loretta Kalina bought K&amp;T Colors in 1986 and relocated it to the current location, 568 S. York Street. As picture framing and the selection of art materials increased, they made a decision to concentrate only on Custom Framing and Artist Supplies.</p>
											<p>In 2010, K&amp;T doubled the size of the store and acquired a totally updated new look. They offer many selections of frame choices for any prints, canvas paintings or pictures large and small.</p>
											<p>The artists material selection grew too and today, it is constantly evolving the business to include many instructional books and craft gift offerings.</p>
											<p>In June 2019, Jennifer and Patrick Wagner bought K&amp;T Colors from Maryann and Loretta. Jen and Pat are both lifelong residents of Elmhurst and have four daughters. They are very excited about keeping K and T just as it is and continue K and T's legacy of safekeeping memories.</p>
